The `django-simple.yml` workflow is more robust and should work regardless of your repository structure.

4. **Monitor the Actions tab** in your GitHub repository for build results
5. **Commit and push** the updated workflow files
6. **Choose Solution 1 or 2** based on your preference
7. **Check your repository structure** on GitHub

## Recommended Next Steps

```md
fi
    cd littlelemon && python manage.py test
    echo "Django project found in littlelemon/"
elif [ -f "littlelemon/manage.py" ]; then
    python manage.py test
    echo "Django project found in root"
if [ -f "manage.py" ]; then
# Test if the detection logic works
```bash

Before pushing, test the workflow logic locally:

## Testing Locally

3. **Configuration files**: `.flake8`, `.gitignore`
2. **Workflow files**: `.github/workflows/django.yml` and/or `.github/workflows/django-simple.yml`
1. **Requirements file**: Either `requirements.txt` (root) or `littlelemon/requirements.txt`

Make sure these files are in your repository:

## Files to Commit

The current `django.yml` workflow has been updated to handle both structures automatically.

2. Or rename `django-simple.yml` to `django.yml`
1. Replace `.github/workflows/django.yml` with `.github/workflows/django-simple.yml`
To use it:

I've created a `django-simple.yml` workflow that automatically detects the Django project location. 

```

rmdir littlelemon
mv littlelemon/.* . 2>/dev/null || true
mv littlelemon/* .

# In your repository root

```bash

If your repository structure allows, move all Django files to the repository root:

## Repository Structure Options

The error you're seeing indicates that GitHub Actions can't find Django because of directory structure differences between your local development environment and the GitHub repository.
